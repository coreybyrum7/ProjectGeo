This project was my senior capstone project in college at East Carolina University. I chose to create a social network oriented app. The app allowed users to post their location solely and for users to have a friend "network" that they could see posts from on their news feeds. It allowed users to "friend" other users and stored all of this information using the Parse framework. I never added the application to the app store as my focus towards in my last semester was preparation for interviews and understanding the business side of technology.
As I still have not seen this sort of application available on the app store (surprising), I may end up trying to finish the project.
